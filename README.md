### Paragraphs
The course on Technical documentation tools introduces Markdown, the simple text format that renders output into multiple formats. Simply open a free version of any of the markdown editors and start documentation.

Even Github supports Markdown editor and the file name has .md as suffix.

### Formatting: Italics and Bold
To make a phrase italic in Markdown, you can surround words with an underscore (_ ). For example, _this_ word would become italic.
This will **really** get your point across.

### Lists
Unordered

Use * with space before the list item.

Ordered

Use number 1 with space before the numbered item. 

Nested list

-Press tab for alignment and then use * or number.



List with separate lines

-Simply add indentation and start the line from where list start and then indent by at least single space.



### Links
